## 🧠 What is important for the Optimizer?

- I put a lot of skill into the cleaner, it should delete the folders so that it is nicer and smoother to use. 
- The design of the optimiser should be beautiful and good to look at.
- Only folders and files that are safe and do not destroy the operating system should be used.
- Much emphasis is also placed on the code, it should not be cluttered, but fancy so that everything is understood.
